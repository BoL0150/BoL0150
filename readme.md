# 👋 Hello! I'm Bo Li.
I am currently a master's student at Beijing Institute of Technology. During my undergraduate studies, I spent more time studying operating systems and database management systems. During my graduate studies, I began to study artificial intelligence, and my research focus on computer vision and MRI super-resolution; In my spare time, I also learn some knowledge about AI infra. Looking ahead, I aspire to become a developer specializing in machine learning systems.
- 🤖 I am interested in Operating System, AI Infra, deep learning frameworks, and LLM inference.
- 🛠 My skills: C++/Linux/Vim (proficient), Python/CUDA/SQL (basic).
